BUGS

* Hitting enter while editing source data submits the page (can't reproduce?)

* "New character" menu item doesn't clear starting moves

TODO

* Class-specific starting gear display is hacky (interacts directly with the panels rather than using modifiers).

* Compendium class support.

* Sourcebook list, tickable to include/exclude.

* Do I want explicitly configured items through Source Data and a full inventory editor in-sheet?

* Make hide/show unticked options per-field?

* Option/control to merge custom data from save file (overwriting same things), so GMs can send out updates and players
    can merge them into existing character (or for starting a new character based on the same custom data as an existing
    one).

* Moves should be able to add modifiers to the character if they're selected.  Multi-class moves in particular need to do something to add the other class' move details.

* Make class icon "editor" only show the dimensions and path, rather than the entire SVG (anti-xss)

* Find out what else is open content from Kickstarter 2012, and add it.

* Add Grim Portents issue 1 races, compendium classes and classes as a source book (code change required: Bladeling race has advanced moves).

* Put code.js, kickstarter2012.js data into a single calls to addSourceData?
