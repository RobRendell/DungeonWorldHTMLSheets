BUGS

* Hitting enter while editing source data submits the page (can't reproduce?)

* "New character" menu item doesn't clear starting moves

TODO

* Class-specific starting gear display is hacky (interacts directly with the panels rather than using modifiers).

* Compendium class support.

* Sourcebook list, tickable to include/exclude.

* Do I want explicitly configured items through Source Data and a full inventory editor in-sheet?

* Checklist fields should have a limit (= level for moves, 1 for race/alignment etc.), and when they have that many selections ticked they hide all non-ticked options (or alternatively end user chooses whether to hide unticked options per-field)

* Moves should be able to add modifiers to the character if they're selected.

* Allow embedding custom stuff into the text of a move, which will be how choices like the Fighter's signature weapon and the Druid's land can be an editable and saved.

* Make class icon "editor" only show the dimensions and path, rather than the entire SVG (anti-xss)

* Find out what else is open content from Kickstarter 2012, and add it.

* Add Grim Portents issue 1 races, compendium classes and classes as a source book (code change required: Bladeling race has advanced moves).
